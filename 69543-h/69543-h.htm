</div>

<p class="drop-cap p2"><span class="firstword">TRAVEL</span> is the greatest of educators, the greatest of civilizers. To come
in contact with men and manners different from those to which we have
been accustomed by birth is to broaden the mind; to teach it forbearance,
sympathy, wisdom; to rob it of its philistinism; to make it cosmopolitan
and not provincial. To come face to face with the great monuments of the
past and of the present, to see what man has done and is doing, is to get a new
idea of the vastness, the imaginative strength, the creative power of the human
mind, to renew your respect for your kind and for yourself, because you belong
to that kind. It may teach you your own littleness, indeed, in itself a
useful lesson. But it also teaches you the greatness of that aggregate of little
individuals to which we give the generic name of man. And to learn this
lesson of reverence for man is to kin yourself with what is best and holiest
in man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>Horse-power, sails, steam, electricity are all at your bidding to-day, ready
harnessed to transport you where you will. If you wish to travel, the world
is yours to command. Fictitious heroes have circled it in eighty days; real
men and women have accomplished the feat in less time. A little leisure and
a little money will enable you to do what a century or so ago would have been
impossible to the greatest potentate on earth, with twenty-four hours of leisure
every day, and the wealth of Indies at his beck and call.</p>

<p>But if you have not the little leisure, if you have not the little money, you
can travel without them. You can travel without passing out of your room,
without quitting your chair. The resources of modern science are inexhaustible.
Mahomet, though a prophet, had to go to the mountain because the
mountain would not come to him. But you need not go to the mountain;
modern science will make it come to you. You have but to say the word.</p>

<p>Here, in this book, for example, are one hundred photographs of one hundred
of the most famous sights, scenes and monuments in the whole world.
To see these sights, these scenes, these monuments, is to attain a liberal education.
Now what is seeing? Seeing, the philosopher will tell you, is to have
certain waves of light strike your eye and create an impression on your retina
of the objects that are in front of you. The retina, in other words, is nothing
but a natural camera obscura. And what is a photograph? A photograph
is a modern invention whereby, by means of an artificial camera obscura, the
sun, the author of all light, is cunningly induced to bind upon paper forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
the impression made by the actual waves of light set in motion by certain
objects. Remember it is not a picture of that object formed by some individual
man and blurred by the personality of the individual who made it. It
is the actual sight, the actual scene, the actual monument, or what not, just as
it would have met your natural retina if you had been there, and simply
reflected from the artificial retina into your natural one. The sun is the true
realist—faithful, literal, exact. Would we not cheerfully exchange Giotto’s
portrait of Dante for a photograph by Sarony, had Sarony and his camera
existed in Dante’s day; or Wagner’s Chariot Race for an instantaneous photograph
of the great Colosseum, with its surging crowds of humanity? The
men and women in Wagner’s masterpiece are vivid and life-like; as types
they are faithful and exact, but the instantaneous photograph would give you
the very outer form and semblance, the body and almost the soul, of individuals
who had once lived, who are now once again living before you. Savages
are said to shrink from being photographed, deeming that a part of
themselves passes into the picture, and the superstitions of savages are metaphors
in which civilized men read a poetical hint of the truth.</p>

<p>Here, then, are one hundred of the greatest of human monuments and the
most magnificent of earthly scenes brought into your very presence by the
witchery of modern science. The selection has been made with the greatest
care so as to be truly representative of all ages, people and climes. Each
photograph is accompanied by a pains-taking and accurate description which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
briefly but succinctly sums up the information that the reader needs for his
guidance. Here, therefore, is a trip round the world with the services of a
guide thrown in, and that trip can be accomplished pleasantly and without
fatigue at an expense which is too ridiculously small to mention.</p>

<p>Well may the modern laugh at Mahomet and his mountain, and snap his
fingers at Phineas Fogg and Nelly Bly. Eighty days quotha! Seventy?
Sixty? Nay, eighty minutes will suffice.</p>

<p id="t_12" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">THE</span> STATUE OF LIBERTY. This colossal statue, by Auguste Bartholdi,
stands on Bedloe’s Island in New York harbor. It is distinguished,
not only by its immense height (three hundred and five feet
six inches from foundation to torch), but by the elegance of its proportions
and its imposing dignity. At night, especially, when the torch is lighted by
electricity, its effect is unique and commanding. The statue was presented
to the American people by France, the cost being defrayed by public subscription.
The sculptor himself took no remuneration. Public subscription here
put up the pedestal. The statue was formally handed over to the President of
the United States by the French delegates on October 28th, 1886.

<p id="t_14" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">THE</span> TOWER OF LONDON, ENGLAND. In all the world there is no
more famous fortress than this ancient citadel of London. Situate in
the oldest portion of the city, on the north bank of the Thames, it at
once arrests the attention of every stranger in the English metropolis. Tradition
ascribes its erection to Julius Cæsar, but tradition is unsupported by historical
evidence, and at the most it is only conjectured that the Romans had a
fortress on this site. It may be stated authoritatively, however, that the Keep
or White Tower (so named because it was formerly whitewashed), which is
now the oldest extant portion of the citadel, was built by William the Conqueror.
As the council chamber of the ancient kings of England, and subsequently
as a prison of state for political offenders, its glory and its shame
are part and parcel of the glory and the shame of all England. Some of the
most momentous events in the history of the country were enacted within its
walls. From an early period it has been the depository of the ornaments and
jewels of the crown.</p>

<p id="t_16" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">WESTMINSTER</span> ABBEY, LONDON. This is the supremely interesting
spot in all London. Its exquisite architecture would alone ennoble
it. But as the sepulchre of sovereigns, heroes, statesmen, authors and
poets, as the scene of some of the most hallowed events in English history, it
makes an even more serious appeal to the imagination. Its very history is involved
in becoming mystery. Tradition asserts that on this site Sebert, King
of the Saxons, built a church and dedicated it to St. Peter. More authentic
history ascribes its inception to Edward the Confessor, who designed it for his
own burial place. Hence, other royal interments followed. William the
Conqueror was crowned here within a few yards of the Confessor’s tomb, and
every succeeding sovereign of England has followed his example. It also has
continued to be the favorite spot for royal weddings and funerals. As it now
stands the Abbey was for the most part rebuilt by Henry III. Henry VII
added the famous chapel which bears his name, and the two towers on the
front were placed there by Christopher Wren. The Poet’s Corner in the south
transept contains tombs or monuments in honor of many of the most famous
of English literary worthies.</p>

<p id="t_18" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword b">ST.</span> PAUL’S CATHEDRAL, LONDON. This, the metropolitan church of
London, is one of the largest and, without exception, the most conspicuous
of its edifices. Built on a slight eminence, which is said to have been
anciently occupied by a temple to Diana, it is the last of a series of Christian
churches that succeeded to the Pagan temple. The first, founded about 610, was
destroyed by fire in 1087. The second succumbed to the Great Fire of 1666.
The present church was begun June 21st, 1675, and was finished in thirty-five
years, under one architect, Sir Christopher Wren. The whole cost, £747,954
2<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>, was paid by a tax on every chaldron of coal brought into London.
The structure is five hundred and fifty feet from east to west by one hundred
and twenty-five feet in width; the front is one hundred and eighty feet wide,
and the top of the cross is four hundred feet from the crypt floor. Carlyle
said of it that it was the only edifice that struck him with a proper sense of
grandeur.</p>

<p id="t_20" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">HOUSES</span> OF PARLIAMENT, LONDON, ENGLAND. This is the
largest, and in some respects the most imposing, of all the public edifices
in England. Gothic in style, in size, at least, it surpasses any
other Gothic building in the world. And in respect to its equipments and the
excellent adaptation of every part to the purposes for which it was erected
and for the transaction of the business to which it is consecrated it is absolutely
unrivaled. Both Houses, Lords and Commons, meet within its walls.
Yet it is a comparatively modern structure. Occupying the site of the Royal
Palace, dwelt in by every English monarch from the time of Edward the Confessor
to Queen Elizabeth, the corner-stone of the present building was not
laid until April 27th, 1840. It covers about eight acres of ground, and has
four fronts, the longest and most effective of which, facing the river Thames,
is nine hundred and forty feet long. The Victoria Tower at the south-west
angle, which is about three hundred and forty feet high and admirably proportioned,
is one of its most effective features.</p>

<p id="t_22" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword b">BANK</span> OF ENGLAND, LONDON. This, the most celebrated moneyed
institution in the world, is situated on Threadneedle Street. Hence, it
is sometimes facetiously alluded to as “The Old Lady of Threadneedle
Street.” It has a branch in the West End of London and nine branches in
the provinces. It was founded July 27th, 1694, as a joint stock association,
with a capital of £1,200,000, which was lent at eight per cent. interest to the
government of William and Mary. And as it began as a servant of the
government so it has continued. At the present moment it has the management
of the public debt and the paying of interest thereon, it holds the deposits
belonging to government and aids in the collection of the public
revenue. It is the bank of all the other banks in England. Its notes are
legal tender, and are convertible into coin. Its credit and reputation have
been absolutely unequaled by any other establishment of the sort. Hence,
the recent discovery of a deficit of £5,000,000 shook the financial world to its
centre. But the bank has been able to meet the emergency.</p>

London has his official residence at the Mansion House. It is situated
nearly opposite the Royal Exchange, on the site of the ancient Stock’s
Market; was begun in 1739 and finished in 1741. In its great banqueting hall,
known as the Egyptian Hall, are given the state banquets. Formerly it was
the ambition of every great London merchant and banker to become Lord-Mayor,
but since the district actually under his jurisdiction has come to be a
very small part of what is known as London, the importance of this functionary
has greatly diminished in the eyes of all save foreigners. As the dispenser of
civic hospitality he receives £8000 a year, with the use of the Mansion House,
furniture, carriages, &amp;c.</p>

<p id="t_26" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword al">LONDON</span> BRIDGE, LONDON, ENGLAND. This is not the London
bridge of Shakespeare’s time, for that was a wooden structure, lined with
houses on either side. The present London bridge is substantially built
of granite on the site of the older one. It cost £2,566,268, and was opened
to the public on August 1st, 1831, by King William IV. There are five
arches, the central one having a span of one hundred and fifty-two feet. The
entire length is nine hundred and twenty-eight feet and the width fifty-four.
A curious interest attaches to the lamp posts along the side, which are cast
from the metal of French cannon captured in the Peninsular War. The constant
stream of traffic that pours across this bridge is prodigious. It is estimated
that every twenty-four hours no less than twenty thousand vehicles and
one hundred and seven thousand pedestrians are borne along in the opposing
currents.</p>

<p id="t_28" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">TRAFALGAR</span> SQUARE, LONDON. The battle of Trafalgar (22d
October, 1805) was won over the combined French and Spanish fleet
by the English, under Lord Nelson, who lost his life at the very moment
of victory. One of the finest open places in London is named after the conflict.
In the centre a massive granite column, one hundred and forty-five feet
in height, rises to the memory of the great admiral, whose statue surmounts it.
The pedestal is adorned with reliefs in bronze, cast with the metal of French
captured cannon, and representing scenes in the career of Nelson. Four colossal
bronze lions, modeled by Sir Edwin Landseer, in 1867, crouch upon pedestals
running out from the column in the form of a cross. The square is paved
with asphalt. Statues of Sir Henry Havelock, of Sir Charles James Napier
and of George IV are distributed around it. Towards the north side are two
fountains, and on the terrace to the north rises the National Gallery, with the
interesting old church of St. Martin in the Fields by its side.</p>

<p id="t_30" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">THAMES</span> EMBANKMENT, LONDON, ENGLAND. At an early
period the banks of the Thames River had many wide stretches of
marsh land, covered by shallow lagoons. From time to time embankments
have been erected, some of them dating from the time of the Romans.
The greatest of all these works is the new Victoria Embankment, leading from
Blackfriars Bridge towards the west, along the north bank of the Thames as
far as Westminster. Built in 1864–70, under the direction of Sir Joseph W.
Bazalgette, it cost nearly $10,000,000. It consists of a macadamized carriageway
about two thousand three hundred yards in length and sixty-four feet
wide. The foot pavement on the land side is sixteen feet broad and on the
river side twenty feet. This entire area was formerly covered by the tide
twice a day. A granite wall eight feet thick protects it on the side next the
Thames. Rows of trees have been planted along the sides of the Embankment,
which will eventually make it a shady and delightful promenade. At
intervals are large openings, with stairs leading to the floating steamboat piers.
It is illuminated at night by electricity.</p>

<p id="t_32" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword b">KENILWORTH</span> CASTLE, ENGLAND. One of the stateliest of feudal
remains in all England is this ruined castle, situated on rising ground
to the west of the village of Kenilworth. Picturesque in itself, famous
as it is in history, it yet derives its chief charm from the glamour thrown over
it by Walter Scott in the novel which he has named after it. Kenilworth Castle
first takes a prominent position in history as one of the strongholds of Simon
de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, in his rebellion against Henry III. Subsequently
it passed into the possession of John of Gaunt, who enlarged and
beautified it. But its highest fame results from the fact that Queen Elizabeth
bestowed it upon her favorite, Robert Leicester, Earl of Dudley, and it was
here that Amy Robsart ended her unhappy life. Cromwell dismantled the
castle. Since his day it has suffered much from the ravages of time, but even
in ruins it retains a potency to delight and to impress.</p>

<p id="t_34" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">WARWICK</span> CASTLE, ENGLAND. Beautiful in itself, famous as the
residence of the Earls of Warwick, and especially of him who went
by the title of the King-maker, Warwick Castle is one of the most
notable edifices in England. Nothing could be more picturesque than its
situation on a rock washed by the Avon. Its two towers are surpassingly
beautiful. The one known as the Clock Tower is here represented. Its
battlements and turrets are full of quaint interest. The grounds which
surround it are a triumph of landscape gardening. And the castle itself
is almost a thousand years old. Legend declares that it was founded
in 915 by the daughter of King Alfred, Ethelfleda. In the war with the
barons in the reign of Henry III it was partially destroyed. In the reign
of Edward III it was restored and strengthened. Additions and improvements
have successively been made. In the reign of James II it passed into
the hands of the Grevilles, and has remained their property ever since.</p>

sovereigns, which distinction it merits through its own beauty, the
beauty of its surroundings and its opulence of historical and legendary
associations. Long before the Normans landed in England it was the seat of
the Saxon Kings. But William the Conqueror founded the present castle; it
was rebuilt by Edward III, was extended by successive sovereigns, and,
finally, in the reign of Queen Victoria, was brought to its present perfection.
The town of Windsor is some twenty miles from London. On a promontory,
overlooking the Valley of the Thames, stands the castle. Its chapels and its
terrace are among the noblest in Europe. The interior is lavishly decorated,
and contains valuable paintings, statuary, furniture, tapestries and plate. In
its vaults lie the bodies of the Kings and Queens of England.</p>

The birth-place of genius must always be full of interest to his fellow-men.
How great then must be the interest in the birth-place of the
greatest of geniuses! That interest is attested by the fact that the walls of the
small, mean-looking edifice in which Shakespeare was born are scrawled all over
with the names of potentates, princes, statesmen, poets and other great and
little men. These, indeed, form a not insignificant part of the curiosities of
the place. The house became the property of the English nation in 1847, and
has been carefully restored. The actual room which witnessed the birth of the
poet is shown, and is in substantially the same condition as when that event
took place. In another room there is a small museum of Shakespearean relics.</p>

place famous for its magnificent private residences, it occupies a pre-eminent
position. Situated in the immediate neighborhood of East Cowes, almost
opposite to the mouth of Southampton Water, no place could be more favored
by nature in its surroundings, and art has come to the assistance of nature.
The grounds, though not large, are exquisite specimens of that princely art of
landscape gardening in which the English have achieved the highest success.
The palace itself is in excellent taste. A high tower in one corner is a conspicuous
object for miles around. From its summit a magnificent view of the
surrounding country may be obtained.</p>

fortress is situated in the village of Blarney, about four miles from
Cork. It was built in the early part of the fifteenth century by Cormac
McCarthy, Prince of Desmond. Little now remains of it but the massive
donjon tower, one hundred and twenty feet high. Its main celebrity arises
from the famous Blarney stone, which endows whoever kisses it with the gift
of flattery, palavering rhodomontade or wheedling eloquence. No one exactly
knows the origin of the stone, nor whence it derived its mysterious powers.
The date 1703 is carved upon it. It is preserved and held in place by two
iron girders between huge mertons of the northern projecting parapet nearly
one hundred feet above the ground. To kiss it has been the ambition of many
generations who laboriously climb up to its dangerous eminence. But the lip
service of so great a multitude is gradually wearing it away.</p>

lakes in County Kerry, of extraordinary beauty and interest. The
largest, known as Lough Leane, is fifteen miles long by three broad. It
contains some thirty islands, the chief of which is Innisfallen, celebrated in
history and story. On the sides of these lakes rise the loftiest mountains in
Ireland, intersected by the wildest ravines, and full of the boldest cascades.
The beauty of the scenery is enhanced by the varied coloring of the thickly-wooded
shores, the gray rock forming an effective contrast to the dark firs, the
brown mountain heath, the light green arbutus and other features in an infinite
variety of foliage and verdure. In the immediate neighborhood of Lough
Leane is Muckross Abbey, founded by Franciscan monks in 1340, now a most
picturesque ruin.</p>

columns, situated on the coast of Antrim, Ireland, has obtained this
name from the legend that it was the commencement of a road planned
by the giants of old to project across the channel from Ireland to Scotland.
And, indeed, it looks almost like a deliberate work of mightier men than we
rather than a frolic of nature. It resembles an immense pier jutting out into
the sea from the base of a stratified cliff about four hundred feet high, to the
length of about seven hundred feet. The pillars composing it are close-fitting,
dark-colored and somewhat irregular hexagons, varying in diameter from
fifteen to twenty inches and sometimes reaching the height of twenty or even
thirty feet. Whinstone dikes separate it into three divisions, known as the
Little Causeway, the Middle or “Honeycomb” Causeway and the Larger
or Grand Causeway. Altogether, it comprises about forty thousand columns,
each consisting of several pieces.</p>

situated on a rocky eminence, three hundred and eighty-three feet high,
in the very heart of the old portion of Edinburgh, is this ancient fortress.
The rock is perpendicular on three sides. On the fourth it slopes away gradually
so that it can be ascended with ease. The fort is supposed to have been
erected in the seventh century, the city gradually growing up around it. In
early Scottish history it was frequently captured by and recaptured from the
English. In the twelfth century it became a royal residence. By the articles
of union it is one of the four fortresses which are to be kept constantly fortified.
It contains accommodations for two thousand soldiers, and its armory
affords space for thirty thousand stands of arms. The Scottish Regalia are
preserved here, and one of the chief objects of interest is the room where
Mary, Queen of Scots, gave birth to James VI, in whom the crowns of England
and Scotland were united. The picture is taken from the Parade Ground.</p>

building occupies the site of an Abbey, founded in A.&#160;D. 1128 by King
David I, of Scotland. The palace itself was begun in the reign of James
IV, was nearly destroyed by Cromwell in 1650, and was rebuilt by Charles II.
But the chief interest of the place centres upon its associations with Mary,
Queen of Scots. Luckily her apartments are preserved in almost their original
condition. The royal chapel, where she celebrated mass to the indignation
of the Protestants, is almost intact. So is the audience chamber in which she
disputed with John Knox. And even to this day is pointed out a deep stain
at the foot of the private stairway to her apartments which is said to be the
blood of the murdered Rizzio. In recent times the palace has been seldom
used as a place of residence. It stands on the top of a huge rock four hundred
and forty-three feet above the sea, and is built in the shape of a quadrangle
with a court in the centre.</p>

famous and the most picturesque ruin in Scotland—indeed in all
Great Britain. Originally founded for the Cistercian monks by David
I, of Scotland, in the twelfth century, it was nearly destroyed by the English—Edward
II—in 1322, and shortly after was rebuilt by Robert Bruce, whose
heart is fabled to be buried under the east window. The abbey was again
burned by Richard II in 1385, and though again restored it was considerably
altered after the Reformation to suit the demands of Presbyterian worship.
Later it was plundered by builders to secure ornaments for houses, and is now
in utter ruin. As it stands, therefore, it belongs mainly to the middle of the
fourteenth century and the first half of the fifteenth, with a good many portions
of much later date. Even in ruins it is one of the noblest exemplars
of the Middle-pointed style of Gothic architecture. Sir Walter Scott made it
the scene of his novel of “The Monastery,” and also celebrated it in some well-known
lines in “Marmion.”</p>

erected it in the days of his greatest financial success, and as the scene
and the cause of his eventual ruin, the castle of Abbotsford must ever
retain a picturesque and pathetic hold upon the lover of literature. It is
situated on the south bank of the Tweed, near Melrose Abbey, and about
twenty-eight miles southeast of Edinburgh. Scott’s aim was to erect a great
mansion on something like feudal principles, where he would dispense a lordly
hospitality akin to that of the ancient nobles whom he loved to celebrate. The
scheme was too grand to succeed. The kindly baronet was involved in ruin,
and spent his last days in a courageous and almost successful effort to battle
against terrible odds. At present Abbotsford has passed out of the hands of
his descendants and become a boarding-school for young ladies. But it is still
a museum of interesting relics, and on account of its associations is much
visited by tourists.</p>

west coast of Mull. The entire island is almost entirely encircled by
cliffs of columnar basalt, hollowed out here and there into caves. Fingal’s,
known also as the Great Cave, is the greatest of these. The entrance is
almost like that of a huge Gothic Cathedral. A lofty arch, sixty feet high by
thirty wide, is supported by columnar ranges of basaltic rock, whose native
blackness is whitened with calcareous stalagmite. The cave is two hundred
and thirty-two feet deep. Its floor is the sea, which flashes many colored
lights upon the ceiling with its pendant clusters of columns, and on the great
cavernous sides, with their countless complicated ranges of gigantic columns,
beautifully jointed and of the most symmetrical though varied forms.</p>

most magnificent bridge in the world, is that across the Firth of Forth,
at Queensbury. Here the estuary of the Forth is divided by the island
of Inchgarvie into two channels, whose depth—two hundred feet—precluded
the construction of intermediate piers. A design for a gigantic suspension
bridge, by Sir Thomas Bouch, had almost been adopted, when the collapse of
the Tay bridge, in 1879, led to the abandonment of the project. A new plan
was accepted from Benjamin Baker. This was a cantilever bridge of steel.
A cantilever is a structure overhung from a fixed base. Work was begun in
1882 and completed in 1889. There are three granite piers, the central one
being on the island; and on those piers three double lattice-work cantilevers
are poised in line, reaching towards each other, and connected at their extremities
by ordinary girders three hundred and fifty feet long, by which the two
main spans are completed. These main spans are each seventeen hundred
feet long, and the total length of the bridge is eighty-two hundred and ninety-six
feet, or a little over one and one-half miles. The under side of the bridge
is one hundred and fifty-two feet above high water.</p>

the margin of the River Dee. The castle is in the Scottish Baronial style of
architecture. It is entirely of granite, and consists of two separate blocks of
buildings united by wings. A tower eighty feet high is surmounted by a
turret twenty feet higher. The entire estate, including a deer forest, comprises
over twenty-five thousand acres. It was purchased by Prince Albert in 1832
from the Earl of Fife. He pulled down the older castle, finding it not exactly
suited to the needs of the royal family, and put up the present imposing

famous of them all. It lies in Perthshire; is eight miles in length, and
has an average breadth of three quarters of a mile. Ben Venue and Ben An
are celebrated mountains on its banks, and it contains a number of exquisite
islands. Among the latter is Ellen’s Island, chosen by Sir Walter Scott as the
scene of “The Lady of the Lake.” Wordsworth and other poets have thrown
the glamour of their genius around Loch Katrine. But it has a more practical

is the name given to an inner enclosure or citadel in Moscow crowded
with palaces, churches and towers, surrounded by a wall sixty feet in
height and two miles in circuit. The Tartar style of architecture, with gilded
domes and cupolas, forms the predominant feature. The palace of the Kremlin
is the residence of the czars. It suffered much damage in the conflagration of
1812, which drove Napoleon out of the city, and was rebuilt in the reign of
Nicholas I in 1838–49. In its restored shape it is rather a mass of buildings,
old and new, than a single, harmonious structure. But it is full of historical
and immediate interest. The tower of Ivan the Great, whose five stories rise
to a height of three hundred and twenty-five feet, is close to the palace. At
its foot lies the Great Bell, the largest in the world—cast in 1730. It was
broken a few years afterwards by the burning of the wooden tower in which
it was suspended. Its height is twenty-six feet four inches, its circumference
sixty-seven feet eleven inches.</p>

Basil was buried, was built in 1554 by Ivan IV. He is said to have
been so much delighted with it that he put out the eyes of its Italian architect,
so that it might never be surpassed. It is a bewildering medley of great and
little domes and towers, not only of different shapes and sizes, but gilded and
painted in all possible varieties of color. There is no main chapel or church,
but each dome surmounts its own chapel, dedicated to some particular saint,
and services are carried on in each without disturbing the worshipers in any
other. Bayard Taylor appropriately styles this church the “apotheosis of
chimneys,” and describes it as the product of some architectural kaleidoscope,
in which the most incongruous things assume a certain order and system.
Relics of St. Basil and of St. John the Idiot are shown to visitors.</p>

end of the famous Unter der Linden, the principal street in Berlin,
forms the entrance to the city from the Thier-garten. Next to the Arc
de l’Etoile in Paris, this is the most magnificent triumphal arch in the world.
It even eclipses the ancient monuments of this kind in Rome. Yet it is not
entirely original. It was erected in 1789–93 by C.&#160;G. Langhans in imitation,
or rather as a glorification, of the model presented by the Propylacum at
Athens. The height is eighty-five feet, the width two hundred and five. There
are five passages (that in the centre reserved for royal carriages), separated by
massive Doric columns. The material is sandstone. A notable feature is the
triumphal car on the summit, the Quadriga of Victoria, done in copper.
Napoleon carried this to Paris in 1807, but it was recovered in 1814. Adjoining
the gate on the side next the town are two wings resembling Grecian
temples, of which that on the right or north side contains a telegraph office
and a pneumatic post-office, while that on the left is the guard-house.</p>

the largest church edifice in the world, and is, without any exception, the
most magnificent specimen of Gothic architecture extant. Begun in 1248, the
work went on very slowly. In 1322 the choir was consecrated. Then the
work lagged still more, and at the beginning of the sixteenth century came to
a sudden close, not being resumed till 1816, since which time more than two
millions of dollars have been expended to bring the edifice to its present state
of completion. The spires are five hundred and twenty-one feet high, and
before the building of the Eiffel Tower this church was the highest edifice in
the world. The height of the roof inside is one hundred and forty-five feet,
the length of the building is four hundred and forty-four feet and the breadth
two hundred and one. The choir is rich in statues, frescoes and fine carvings.

centuries. The French sacked and partially burned it in 1693; it was subsequently
restored, but being struck by lightning in 1764, it has since been
suffered to remain in ruins. As such it is one of the most magnificent remains
of the Middle Ages—a square massive building, roofless, with a round tower
at one end and an octagonal one at the other. Some idea of its strength may
be gained from the fact that the walls of the round tower are twenty-two feet
thick. In one of the cellars is the famous Tun of Heidelberg, a huge copper

The rock is known as the Gibraltar of the Rhine. The ancient Romans
recognized its commanding position and erected here a castrum or camp. In
1018 the Franconian king, Dagobert, presented it to the bishops of Treves,
who made it their stronghold. It has successfully resisted many sieges, but
was twice captured by the French, first in 1631 and again in 1798. After the
Peace of Luneville in 1801 they blew it up. Restored to Prussia with the
Peace of Paris, the French were forced to contribute 15,000,000 of francs to
place it in its former condition. At present it is defended by four hundred
cannon, and fifty thousand stands of needle guns are stored in its armory. It
is capable of accommodating one hundred thousand men, but five thousand
are sufficient to man it properly. The summit of the rock commands a magnificent
view of the surrounding country. A bridge of boats connects the

shops, which are backed up against its very walls. It is unfinished, only one of
the towers being complete. The other is but half-way up, where it has been
capped over, and has remained so for centuries. Nevertheless, nothing can
detract from the majesty of the church itself. Out from the littleness of its
surroundings it calmly rears its splendid front. Its solitary tower soars upward
to the height of four hundred and three feet, with delicate open arches that
look like fretted work, so that Napoleon said: “It looked as if made of
Mechlin lace.” The chimes of ninety-nine bells are deservedly famous. The
interior is glorified by the presence of Rubens’ two greatest pictures, “The
Elevation of the Cross” and “The Descent from the Cross.” Begun about
the middle of the thirteenth century, it suffered seriously from fire in the sixteenth
century, and the greater part of the present edifice dates from that

Wellington and Blucher. To be sure, Wellington is reported to have said:
“You have spoilt my battlefield,” when he saw the artificial mound surmounted
by a Belgic lion of cast-iron, which has been raised in the centre of the field.
But at least its one hundred and fifty feet of height afford the opportunity for
an excellent bird’s-eye view of the entire field. And the old house of Hougemont,
whose building and orchard were occupied by the British Guards, and where

the Boulevard des Capucines and the Tuileries Gardens. It was designed
by Louis XIV, in 1686, to contain public buildings, such as the Mint,
the Royal Library, the various academies, &amp;c. This plan was subsequently
much modified. The buildings, which are of Corinthian architecture of a
severely uniform appearance, are mainly occupied by banks and other fiscal
institutions. A grand equestrian statue of Louis XIV once stood in the centre
of the square, but it was destroyed in 1792, and in 1806 its place was taken by
the famous Vendome column, a stone shaft one hundred and forty-three feet
high, covered with the metal of cannon taken from the Prussians and Austrians.
It is surmounted by a statue of Napoleon, and is ornamented by bas-reliefs
commemorative of that hero’s campaign in 1805. In 1871 column and statue
were both pulled down by the Commune, but the Republic under Thiers
repaired and replaced them.</p>

<p id="t_94" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">THE</span> GARDEN OF THE TUILERIES. The Tuileries is but the remains
of its former glory. The main front of the building was burned
by the Commune in 1871, and after remaining a picturesque ruin for
some years was at length removed. The wing nearest the Rue de Rivoli
shared the fate of the front, but was rebuilt, together with the Pavillon de
Marsan, which formed the angle. The Pavillon de Flore, at the other end,
suffered much less, and had only to be restored. Both wings, and, indeed, the
entire building, are a marvel of exterior ornamentation. Before the Revolution
the Tuileries was only the occasional residence of the French sovereign,
but Napoleon made it his principal abode, and his example was followed by
his successors. The picture is taken from the exquisite gardens of the Tuileries
facing the Place de la Concorde.</p>

<p id="t_96" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword a">ARC</span> DE TRIOMPHE, PARIS, FRANCE. This, the distinctive
triumphal arch of Paris, is more specifically known as l’&#160;Arc de l’&#160;Étoile,
to differentiate it from three other triumphal arches of less celebrity.
It stands at the west end of the Avenue des Champs Elysées on the
summit of a slope, which makes it visible from all parts of Paris and the
environs. It is not only the largest arch in existence, but the most magnificent
ever erected. Begun by Napoleon in 1806, to commemorate the wars of
the Revolution and of the Empire, it was completed thirty years later by
Louis Philippe. The total cost was about $2,000,000. The height of the
arch above the ground is one hundred and fifty-two feet, its width one hundred
and thirty-eight feet, its thickness sixty-eight feet. The main archway
measures ninety feet in height and forty-five in width; the smaller lateral
archways are each fifty-seven feet by twenty-five. The bas-reliefs represent the
most famous events of 1792–1815. Finest of all are the two colossal groups
on each side of the central arch facing the Champs Elysées, cut in full relief
and representing the “Departure of the Troops in 1792” and “The Triumph
of Napoleon after the Austrian Campaign.”</p>

hewn out of a single block of granite brought from Finland, was the
gift of the Emperor Nicholas, when in 1841 the remains of the Emperor were
brought back from St. Helena by the Prince de Joinville. The crypt is
adorned with marble reliefs symbolical of Napoleon’s reforms and with twelve
colossal figures of victory and sixty mouldering banners captured from the
enemy. There are also monuments to Vauban and Turenne, Napoleon’s most
illustrious predecessors in the field. At the entrance to the crypt lie the
bodies of Bertrand and Duroc, the near friends and companions of Napoleon.
The monuments or the remains of various members of the Bonaparte family
are in the upper part of the church.</p>

Pont de la Concorde. The old façade was in the Rue de l’&#160;Université at the
back; the new one, with its Corinthian colonnade, was erected in 1804. The
hall is a semi-circular room, with the President’s chair facing the extremity of
the half circle. Here sat the Council of Five Hundred, Louis Philippe’s
Chamber and Napoleon III’s Corps Legislatif, and here at present sit the
deputies elected from the various districts of the French republic. Orators
address the Chamber from the tribune, which is placed immediately under the
President’s chair. Voting is done by means of white or blue cards, placed in
tin receptacles that are handed round by the ushers; the white being an
“aye,” the blue “nay.”</p>

the handsomest, though not the largest, temple of amusement in the

Milan, holds three thousand. The stage, however, in cubic and superficial
area, is the largest known. It is equaled by others in depth, but surpasses
them all in breadth. The exterior is bewildering in the richness of its decorations.
The grand staircase and the foyer are in magnificent keeping with the
exterior. This building is one of the creations of the Second Empire. More
than one hundred houses were torn down to clear the square on which it
stands. It was inaugurated on January 1st, 1875. The total cost is estimated
at $8,000,000. The opera is managed by a director, who receives from the
State an allowance of eight hundred thousand francs a year. He has to
supply what is necessary and run all risks.</p>

being three hundred metres or nine hundred and eighty-four feet in
height, as against the five hundred and fifty-five feet five and one-eighth
inches of the Washington Monument, which comes next in altitude among all
the edifices of man. The tower was constructed by Alexander G. Eiffel for the
Paris Exhibition of 1878. Its foundations are sunk to a depth of fifty feet in
the sandy soil of the Champs de Mars, and the four massive piers, which form
the first stage of the tower, are so planted as to distribute the enormous weight
of the structure (sixty-five hundred tons) in the best way possible. In spite of
this weight the general impression is one of grace and lightness. The summit
is crowned by a cupola with an exterior balcony, whence a magnificent panorama
of Paris and its surroundings is unveiled. Elevators carry passengers
up to the summit, the time consumed by the ascension being from six to seven
minutes.</p>

portion consists of a circular edifice one hundred and eighty feet high and
one hundred and eighty-nine feet in diameter, crowned by a dome, and flanked
with two minarets two hundred and seventy feet high. On each side extends
a wing in the form of a curve, six hundred and sixty feet in length, giving the
entire edifice the appearance of an imposing crescent. On a level with the
spring of the dome is a terrace adorned with thirty statues. The view of Paris
from the terrace or the towers is superb. Below the balcony, in front of the
central building, gushes a large cascade, which descends to a huge basin one

in the elaborately decorated Salle des Fetes, which seats six thousand persons.
There are also collections of sculptures and antiquities.</p>

small town thirty-five miles south-east of Paris. It is famous for the
royal palace, which is situated in a magnificent park or forest, fifty miles
in circumference, and covering an area of forty-two thousand five hundred
acres. The building itself is said to occupy the site of a fortified chateau, built
by Louis VII in 1162. But it was Francis I who transformed the mediæval
fortress into a palace of almost unparalleled extent and magnificence. Henry
IV did much towards its embellishment. Here his successor, Louis XIV, revoked
the Edict of Nantes. It was a favorite residence of Napoleon I, whose
sentence of divorce from Josephine was pronounced here. Louis Philippe
and Napoleon III spent large sums in restoring it. The exterior of the building,
with the exception of several pavilions, is only two stories in height.
The interior is a splendid example of decorative work. Some of the greatest
French and Italian artists of the epoch of its creation were employed upon it.
Especially beautiful is the chamber of Anne of Austria, the mother of Louis
XIV, and Queen-regent in his minority, who made Fontainebleau her favorite
residence, and spent money lavishly in the decoration of her chamber.</p>

built by Louis XIV in 1661, and became a royal residence in 1681. As
such it has held a great place in the history of France. It is now used as a
historical museum. The garden which surrounds it is justly celebrated for its
extreme beauty. Among its chief marvels are the fountains, richly adorned
with bronze statues, and from the centre of each rises a column of water to
the height of forty feet, encircled by sixteen inclined jets of water, the whole
forming a sort of basket. The water which feeds the fountains is brought
from the Seine by the machine of Marly, constructed at enormous expense
after the failure of the plan to turn the River d’&#160;Eure from its course.</p>

her Swiss village, and here, as well as in the adjacent Petit Trianon, she and
her court played at shepherds and shepherdesses. The Grand Trianon is built
in the Italian style, with the rooms all on one floor. The interior is exquisitely

of Spain. The sport has been described as a tragedy in three acts.
First, the bull is let out and goaded to fury by the lances of the mounted
picadores. If a picador is thrown or his horse is wounded the chulos rush in
and attract the bull by waving their cloaks in front of him, saving themselves,
if need be, by leaping over the palisade which encloses the circus. When the
bull begins to flag the chulos attack him with barbed darts, called banderillas,
which they stick into his neck. The third act introduces the matador, who
enters alone. He holds in his right hand a naked sword, in his left a muleta
or small stick with a piece of scarlet silk attached. The bull rushes blindly
at the muleta. The matador, if he be skillful, plunges the sword into the left
shoulder and the animal drops dead. Sometimes, however, he misses his first
aim and then he has to try again. Sometimes he is wounded or even killed and
then a new matador appears on the scene.</p>

of buildings built of bricks slightly reddened. The principal building was
begun in 1248 and finished in 1314. Here the Moorish kings lived, surrounded
by their court and nobility, a total population of some forty thousand souls. Its
degradation dates from the day of the Castilian conquest, for the alterations
and restorations made by the Spanish kings were without judgment. Philip V,
early in the eighteenth century, was its last royal occupant. After his desertion
the place was allowed to fall into decay until 1862, when the Spanish
government took it in charge. Happily, the most important portions still
exist, and present a bewildering array of pavilions, courts, colonnades, fountains,

a mosque. Authorities generally agree that it is the finest specimen of a
Moorish mosque in all Europe. The southern suburb communicates with the
town by means of an ancient bridge across the River Guadalquiver, whose
sixteen arches exhibit the usual combination of Moorish and Roman architecture.
At one end of the bridge is an elevated statue of the patron saint,
St. Raphael, whose effigy abounds all through the city. Our picture is taken

high at its highest point; its length, from north to south, about three miles;
its circumference about six. It is mainly composed of compact limestone and
dense gray marble, varied by beds of red sandstone and tissues of osseous
breccia. The north face is almost perpendicular, but the east side is full of
tremendous precipices. It came into possession of the English by conquest
during the war of the succession in 1704. Since then they have spent immense
sums in its fortification, with so much success that they have retained it against
the combined efforts of France and Spain. From the sea the rock presents a
grim enough aspect with its immense cannon, its piles of balls and bombs, and
its apparent lack of vegetation. But a closer view shows patches of fruit
trees, together with a great variety of odoriferous shrubs.</p>

stone of the Casino was laid in 1858, and gambling tables had existed in
Monaco two years previous to that date, but it was not till 1860, when M. Blanc,

about four hundred thousand visitors. The inhabitants of Monaco are not

fifteen thousand seven hundred and eighty-one feet above sea level.
During the last century and a half it has been a favorite resort of tourists,
and especially of scientists, as its glaciers and other marvelous features are full
of interest and instruction. But it was not till 1786 that Balmat and Paccard
made the first ascension, followed in 1787 by Saussure. Many accidents have
happened here in the past. In 1870 a party of eleven, two of them Americans,
all perished in the snow-crowned heights. Nowadays the ascensions
are more numerous, and, with proper precautions, are considered absolutely
safe, though very fatiguing, and occupying three days. The view from the
valley of Chamouni is of extraordinary beauty. It has been celebrated by
Coleridge in one of his most famous poems, and has been the theme of countless
other pens. Not always is the “monarch of mountains” visible from Chamouni,
as his imperial front is frequently hidden from the sight of his worshipers.
But the photograph here presented is taken on a fortunate day,

glacier fills the highest gorges of the chain of Mont Blanc, and extends
over a distance of twelve miles into the Valley of Chamouni.
It is formed by the masses of snow and ice which collect during the long
winters. In appearance it is just what its name implies, a Sea of Ice, whose
tumultuous waves seem to have been suddenly frozen, not while they were
being lashed to fury by a tempest, but at the very moment when the wind
had subsided and left them high indeed, but rounded and blunted in outline.
Slowly—so slowly that the motion is imperceptible—it flows down the inclined
plane between two mountains cracking, groaning and melting until it resolves
itself into a torrent, known as the Arveiron. There are other seas of ice among
the Alps, but this by pre-eminence is known as the Mer de Glace. It was in
the study of this region that Agassiz conceived his glacial theory.</p>

region, rising like a sort of triangular obelisk into the clouds. Its sides are
so precipitous that the snow itself can hardly find a lodgment. For a long
period it was deemed inaccessible to man. On the 14th of July, 1865, a party,
consisting of Messrs. Hudson, Whymper and Hadow, with Lord Francis
Douglas and three guides, succeeded in reaching the summit, but in the descent
Mr. Hudson lost his footing, and all save Mr. Whymper and two guides, who

hundred and five feet above sea level, or four thousand four hundred
and seventy-two feet above Lake Lucerne, is not one of the highest
mountains of Switzerland, but the beautiful and extensive view commanded
from the Kulm, or summit, makes it one of the most popular. The famous
Riggenbach cog-wheel railway brings travellers up to the Kulm, a small, bare
space, whence the eye takes in a panorama of three hundred miles in circuit.
Immediately below lie the lakes of Lucerne and Zug, their shores lined with
picturesque little towns. Eight other lakes, including a bit of Zurich, may be
counted in the distance. Snow-capped mountains—the Jungfrau, the Wetterhorn,
the Schreckhorn, the grand snow-covered peaks of the Bernese Alps and
countless other peaks of lesser note—stretch away on every side to the horizon.
The railway up the mountain is of ordinary gauge. Along the centre runs a
cogged track, into which a cog-wheel on the locomotive works, thus giving the
power for the ascent. In going down the brakes are worked by atmospheric
pressure. The construction of this five miles of line, which in its ascent overcomes
about one mile of altitude, cost about $300,000.</p>

attraction of the place is not the scenery either way along the valley, but a
view that is caught through a depression in the mountains on the southern

Surrounded by stupendous precipices, her surface is broken by valleys, ravines
and glaciers, which from a distance look like creases in the mantle of snow
that covers her enormous flanks. The first ascent of this mountain was made
on August 3d, 1811.</p>

as the eighth wonder of the world. In truth, it is a marvelous edifice.
“Gothic art,” as Taine says, “here attains its triumph and its extravagance.”
Nowhere else is it so pointed, so complex, so highly embroidered,
so full of delicate detail. It differs from most Gothic cathedrals in being
built, not of dark stone, but of beautiful, lustrous white Italian marble.
Begun in 1386, it was not fully completed until 1805, at the direction of Napoleon.
The design is said to be taken from Monte Rosa, one of the loftiest
peaks of the Alps. Its ninety-eight sculptured pinnacles, rising from every
part of the body of the church, certainly bear a striking resemblance to the
splintered ice crags of Savoy. Next to St. Peter’s, at Rome, and the Cathedral
at Seville, this is the largest church in Europe, covering, as it does, an
area of fourteen thousand square yards.</p>

<p id="t_142" class="drop-cap"><span class="firstword">PANORAMA</span> OF VENICE, ITALY. No city in the world is more fascinating
than Venice. Its very situation makes it unique, built as it is
on a cluster of small islands, a hundred or more in number, in the lagoon
of the same name. A long, narrow sand-bank, divided by several inlets, separates
the lagoon from the Adriatic. The largest of the islands is the Isola di
Rialto, which gives its name to the famous bridge. The Grand Canal winds
through the city in a double curve, like the letter S, and divides it into two
unequal parts. The one hundred and forty-six smaller canals and a perfect
network of small streets and bridges form the other thoroughfares. The
splendid churches, the vast treasures of art and the magnificent palaces, remind
one of the glories of the past, and fill the present with a surpassing beauty.
By the fifteenth century Venice had become the greatest republic in Europe
and the focus of its commerce. The immense wealth of its merchant princes
enabled them to gratify their artistic sense in the superb monuments still
extant.</p>

strange jumble of all styles of architecture, Christian as well as Saracenic,
yet both without and within breathing a rich and wonderful
harmony. The present building, dedicated in 1085, takes the place of an
older and simpler structure, that was destroyed by fire in 976. In front of
the church, to the southwest, rises the Square Campanile, surmounted with the
figure of an angel. To the east of the church the famous Piazzetta, or “Little
Square,” extends to the Grand Canal, glorified by the Palace of the Doges, or
ancient rulers of the city, which some architects look upon as the finest building
in the world. It is from this Piazzetta that the picture is taken. The
square in front of St. Mark’s is the grand focus of attraction in Venice, and
in summer nearly the entire population congregate here.</p>

marble-fronted palaces, whose very names awaken a thrill of historic
or romantic recollection. Gondolas dart up and down among the waters, and,
alas! the disillusionizing modern steamboat puffs its vicious way through the
complaining waters. About half-way in its course the canal is crossed by the
famous Rialto bridge, a single arch of unique and elegant construction,
seventy-four feet in length, resting on twelve thousand piles. This was built
in 1588, subsequent therefore to the period of Venice’s greatest glory. The
ancient Rialto, which Shakespeare speaks of as the meeting place of the merchants,
was not this bridge, but the Exchange which used to go by the same
name, and was long the centre of trade and commercial life in this city.</p>

whereon is situated the former residence of the Doges, an ancient seat of
government. Ruskin calls this “the principal work of Venice.” Originally
built in 800, five times destroyed and as many times rebuilt in a style of greater
magnificence, the present structure dates from the fourteenth century. It is
in the Moorish-Gothic style. The form is an irregular square; the west side,
facing the Piazzetta (two hundred and thirty feet in length), and the south
side, facing the sea (two hundred and twenty feet in length), are flanked by
two colonnades, one above the other, with exquisite traceries. The mouldings
of the upper colonnade are especially rich. The interior court of the building
presents a wilderness of elegant columns, cornices, arches, carvings, sculptures
and bas-reliefs. A magnificent collection of Venetian paintings is housed
within these walls. On the east side the palace is connected with the prisons
by the so-called Bridge of Sighs, which owes most of its fame to Byron’s sentimentality.</p>

Cathedral of Pisa, begun in 1063, and consecrated in 1118, forms, with
its Baptistery and Campanile, the most singular group of buildings
in the world. Their beauty is equal to their singularity. The church itself
is constructed entirely of white marble, with black and colored ornamentation.
An elliptical dome covers the centre. The façade, adorned in the lower story
with columns and arches, and in the upper story with four open galleries, is
of exquisite and dainty beauty. So, likewise, is the Baptistery, a circular
structure, surrounded by half columns below and a gallery of small, detached
columns above, the whole crowned by a conical dome. But the strangest
effect of all is produced by the Campanile, better known as the Leaning Tower,
from the fact that it is thirteen feet out of the perpendicular. That this obliquity
was accidental and due to the sagging of the foundations is now generally
agreed. Aside from this peculiarity the Campanile would arrest attention by
its winsome grace.</p>

it is, that bridges were built here and repeatedly demolished before Taddeo
Gaddi erected the present structure of three arches. It is flanked by shops,
which have belonged to the goldsmiths and jewelers since the fourteenth century,
and is still the centre of their trade. Above the roofs of these shops
runs the gallery of the Grand Duke, built as a secret passage between the
Uffizi and the Pitti Palaces. The bridge itself might easily be mistaken for
a continuous street by the stranger, except for the vacant space over the central

is known as the Palazzo Vecchio, or Old Palace. Begun in 1298, it is
a striking example of the Florentine castles of the Middle Ages, with its enormous
projecting battlements and its disproportionate bell tower, defiantly stuck
upon the walls without regard to symmetry, and almost overhanging the battlements.
It is situated in the Piazza della Signoria, the historic, as well as
the commercial, centre of Florence. The court is adorned with a fountain
and sculptured columns. In front of the entrance is Bandinelli’s group of
Hercules and Cacus. At right angles to the left is the Loggia dei Lanzi, an

the Duomo or Dome, though its official designation is Santa Maria del
Fiore. Arnolfo di Cambio began it in 1298; he was succeeded by
Giotto, and the dome was added by Brunelleschi. The latter is not only beautiful
in itself, but is interesting as the first of the great domes of the modern
world. A half-finished façade was destroyed by fire, and the deficiency was
not supplied until 1875–1884. The interior is impressive, though almost entirely
devoid of ornamentation. Outside the church, to the left, is the Campanile,
an exquisite work by Giotto; so exquisite that Charles V declared it
ought to be kept in a glass case. In front is the Baptistery, an octagonal
building, surmounted by a dome. It was begun in 1352 and finished in 1358.
Its chief attraction lies in the bronze doors, especially those by Lorenzo
Ghiberti, which Michael Angelo eulogized as worthy to be the gates of
Paradise.</p>

was surmounted by the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus and the citadel
of the city. Hence, here was the head of the Roman state and the
shrine of their religion. But temple and citadel have vanished and in their
place is a group of buildings erected by Paul III from the designs of Michael
Angelo. On the right is the Palace of the Conservatori, on the left the
Museum of the Capitol and between the two, occupying the third side of the
square, is the Palace of the Senator, a modern Roman patrician with that title.
The photograph shows the best approach to the square up the grand stair-case,
known as La Cordonnata, which in its present form dates from 1736. At the
foot of the stairs are two Egyptian lions, and at the summit, on the angles of
the balustrades, two ancient colossal statues of Castor and Pollux, standing by
the sides of their horses. These were found in the sixteenth century. In the
centre of the square is the bronze equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius.</p>

was built by the Emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his
family. The same emperor also erected the bridge now known as St.
Angelo—anciently as the Pons Ælius—which crosses the Tiber opposite the
castle. Tradition affirms that Gregory the Great in 589 changed the name in
memory of a vision of the Archangel Michael, who appeared to him standing
on the summit of the mausoleum. He built a chapel on the summit, but subsequently
this was replaced by the statue still extant. During the Middle
Ages this was the fortress of Papal Rome, and its history at that period is
bound up in the history of the city itself. It has also served as a prison, and
part of it was up to recent times still used for that purpose. It has suffered
much from sieges and the ravages of time, and is now but the skeleton of the
magnificent pile erected by Hadrian. No vestige remains of the shell of
Parian marble which encircled it, while the statues were torn off to be used as
missiles against the Goths, and later as cannon balls.</p>

of St. Peter. As early as A.&#160;D. 90 an oratory was raised on the
spot; in 306 this was followed by a basilica. The present edifice was begun
in 1506, and after employing the talents of Bramante, Michel Angelo and other
architects, was dedicated by Urban III in 1626. The magnificent dome was
mainly the work of Michael Angelo, though his plan was somewhat modified
by Giacomo della Porta. The impressive colonnades, which almost encircle
the square and lead up to the front, were added in 1667. The façade is confessedly
a failure. But nothing can mar the beauty of this extraordinary
edifice. Although it occupies some two hundred and forty thousand square
feet, the interior, from its exquisite proportions, does not at once impress the
beholder with a sense of its vastness. That grows upon one by degrees. The
Vatican, which adjoins St. Peter’s, is an equally enormous and beautiful building,
which comprises the residence of the popes, an astounding museum of
pictures and statues and a library of unexampled historic interest.</p>

the Flavian amphitheatre, is the most magnificent relic of ancient Rome.
Begun by Vespasian in A.&#160;D. 72, it was dedicated by Titus in A.&#160;D. 80
and was subsequently added to by Domitian. As the circus of the public
games for nearly four hundred years, it was the scene of gladiatorial conflicts
and of the persecution of the Christian martyrs. After the triumph of
Christianity it fell into neglect, and suffered continuous spoliation as a quarry
for the material of new buildings. Finally, in 1750, Benedict XIV rescued it
in its present condition by dedicating it to the memory of the Christian
martyrs who had suffered therein. A cross in the middle of the amphitheatre
is continually visited by the pious. “As it now stands,” says Forsyth, “the
Colosseum is a striking image of Rome itself, decayed, vacant, serious, yet
grand, half gray and half green, exact on one side and fallen on another,
with consecrated ground in its bosom.” Hillard calls it “a great tragedy in
stone.” It was originally built to seat ten thousand spectators. There were
three orders of architecture used in the four stories; the first, Doric; second,
Ionic; third and fourth, Corinthian. In each of the lower tiers there were
eighty arches. The height of the outer wall was one hundred and fifty-seven
feet, the circumference one thousand six hundred and forty-one feet, the entire
superficial area being six acres.</p>

after the establishment of universal peace, consecrated it to all the gods. In
A.&#160;D. 608 it was dedicated as a Christian church by Pope Boniface IV, under
the name of Santa Maria ad Martyres. The portico is of faultless beauty,
and the interior, as the picture shows, is a perfect rotunda, impressive in its
grand simplicity. The domed ceiling is lighted solely by an aperture twenty-three
feet in diameter, the wall being supported by a huge bronze ring. An
additional interest for moderns lies in the tombs of Raphael, Caracci and

The style of architecture is Byzantine. The exterior is not as imposing

an andro-sphinx, or man-headed lion, one hundred and eighty-eight feet
nine and one-half inches in length, hewn out of the solid rock. Steps led
down to its front, where there was a sanctuary and tablets. But the sands
covered all save the head, shoulders and back, which rose from the surrounding
desert with a startling and almost fearsome abruptness. In this condition the
monument was allowed to remain for centuries. But more recently excavations
have been started to restore it to its pristine state, and before long the entire
colossal figure will be bared to view.</p>

Cairo. It contains the largest and most famous of those mysterious
sepulchral monuments known as Pyramids, which the ancient Egyptians
were fond of raising. Three of these are especially famous—the Great Pyramid
called the “Splendid,” which is the mausoleum of Cheops, and is four hundred
and fifty feet nine inches high; the scarcely inferior Pyramid of Chepheren,
and the Pyramid of Mycerinus, which is much smaller. These mountains of
masonry, built of stones whose huge size perplexes modern engineers to
account for the method of their handling, were designed by the kings of the
early Egyptian dynasties as their tombs. Their leading idea was durability,
and by concealment of the entrance, and tortuous and complicated passages,
they strove to baffle the vandal. Yet all these tombs have been shamefully
profaned.</p>

in Egypt to leave Karnak to the last, as the crown of his explorations.
It is, indeed, the most marvelous ruin along the Nile. Yet, though in
ruins, it preserves all its original character. It lies amid the ruins of Thebes.
It was intended for a temple. But it is not so much a temple as a city of
temples, of palaces, courts, columns and obelisks enclosed by a great wall of
circuit about a mile and a half in circumference. The Great Hall alone,
which is the largest of all the monuments, measures three hundred and
forty feet by one hundred and seventy. The Temple of Amenophis, here represented,
is one of the finest of the smaller remains.</p>

situated on a hill called Acra, purports to be built over the site of
Calvary and the actual tomb of Jesus. Not only that tomb itself, but
the tombs of Joseph and Nicodemus, the places where the Saviour appeared
after His resurrection to Mary Magdalene and to Mary, His mother; where
Constantine’s mother found the true cross, &amp;c., &amp;c., are pointed out to visitors.
Not everybody accepts the genuineness of the site. But, at least, it was for
the reconquest of the Holy Sepulchre that the Crusades were instituted, and
for fifteen hundred years kings and queens, knights and pilgrims have knelt
and prayed here. The church is a Byzantine structure, which was commenced
in 1103 A.&#160;D., was partly destroyed by fire in 1808, and has since been
restored. Some parts of it, however, are said to date back to the Empress
Helena.</p>

world could have more interest for the Christian traveler than the
Garden of Gethsemane, the scene of our Lord’s agony on the eve of
His crucifixion. It is known that it was a garden or orchard belonging to a
small estate at the foot of Mount Olivet, somewhere on the east slope of the
Kedron Valley and about half a mile from Jerusalem. But whether the
present enclosure which is pointed out as the identical garden be so or not is
a matter which archæologists have not yet settled. Certainly, the garden is
very old and very venerable; its few olive trees date back to an unknown
antiquity, and it may very well have been extant in almost its present condition
in the time of Christ.</p>

the Heliopolis of the Greeks, once famous as the most magnificent of
Syrian cities, which passed successively under the rule of the Persians,
Greeks and Romans, was plundered by the Arabs in A.&#160;D. 639, by the
Christians and others during the Crusades, and was finally sacked and dismantled
by the Tartars, under Tamerlane.—Baalbek to-day exists only as a
mass of ruins; but its very ruins are of the utmost magnificence. The most
imposing are the remains of the Great Temple. But the most beautiful is the
Circular Temple—a semi-circular cella surrounded on the outside by eight
Corinthian columns. Within there is a double tier of smaller pillars, the
lower row being Ionic and the upper Corinthian. In modern times, and,
indeed, up to the present century, this was used as a Greek church, but it is
now deserted and choked with débris.</p>

the glory of Indo-Mussulman architecture. It was built by the Emperor
Shah Jehan for himself and his favorite wife, Nourmahal, who died in
child-birth in 1629. For twenty-two years twenty thousand men were employed
in its construction, the total cost reaching $16,000,000. Built of white
marble, it forms a quadrangle of one hundred and ninety square yards, surmounted
by a lofty dome, with smaller domes at each corner and four graceful
minarets one hundred and thirty-three feet high. The great central hall is
paved with squares of various-colored marbles, while the walls, tombs and
screens are ornamented by exquisite mosaic work. The elegance and delicacy
of the design and the elaborate perfection in every detail of the workmanship
are alike marvelous. It seems almost like a castle built in a dream, a fabric
of mist and sunbeams, which would dissolve at a touch. Yet it has resisted
the encroachments of time and the barbarian despoiler, and has come down to
our day almost perfect.</p>

of Indian-Mahometan architecture. Although it gives the general impression
of lightness, grace, delicacy, it is by no means a small building. Externally
it is two hundred and thirty-five feet east and west by one hundred
and ninety feet north and south. The court yard is one hundred and fifty-five
feet square. The mass is also considerable, as the whole is raised on a
terrace of artificial construction, by the aid of which it stands well out from
the surrounding buildings. Its chief beauty consists in its court yard, which
is wholly of white marble from the pavement to the summit of its domes. The
interior is a bewildering maze of columns of exquisite proportions.</p>

Valley is one of the most marvelous natural parks in the world.
About nine miles in length and from three-quarters of a mile to a mile
and a quarter in width, it is sunk almost a mile below the level of the surrounding
country. High granite walls rise sheer and inaccessible on each side.
Cataracts of the wildest and strangest beauty abound. Flowers of every hue
cover the ground. Where all is wonderful it might seem hard to select. Yet
by common consent the surpassing feature of the valley scenery is the great
cliff, known as El Capitan or The Captain. “It is doubtful,” says Professor
J.&#160;D. Whitney, “if anywhere in the world there is presented so squarely cut,
so lofty and so imposing a face of rock.” Not indeed that it is the highest of
the gigantic brotherhood. Its three thousand three hundred feet are exceeded
in its own vicinity by over thousands of feet. But no other rock, here or elsewhere,
has so majestic and awe-compelling a presence.</p>

America as Washingtonia. But the pride of science and of patriotism
have had to bow to the will of the populace, which has been satisfied with the
simpler and therefore more energetic title of Big Trees. They are confined to
the western portion of the California range, occurring in detached groups or
groves at an altitude of from four thousand to five thousand feet above the
sea. Some of these vast vegetable columns are upwards of thirty feet in
diameter, and from three to four hundred feet in height. One of the trees in
the Mariposa Grove, represented in the accompanying engraving—some
twenty-five feet in diameter—stands directly arching the roadway, and a miniature
tunnel has been cut through it which admits of the passage of a four-horse
stage coach.</p>

in the Yellowstone occupies some thirty square miles. Within this comparatively
limited area is a most stupendous exhibition of hot springs,
water geysers, mud geysers and steaming caldrons of boiling water. No two
of the geysers are alike. The Grotto simply churns and makes a great noise.
The others go off at various intervals; some every hour, some all the time
and some once a month; some on alternate days, yet the day they are active
going over ninety minutes. Nor is their style of action the same. Some play
with labored pumping, others throw an unbroken stream; some wear themselves
out in a continuous effort, others subside only to recommence again
repeatedly. An eruption may extend from two to twenty minutes, the approximate
time occupied by the Grand, or even to one hour and twenty minutes, a
period that the Giant has been timed to play. The Grand is the largest
geyser in the world, shooting a vast column of water over two hundred feet
into the air.</p>

one hundred square miles there are here gathered the loveliest valleys,
the grandest canons, the most marvelous mountains, lakes, rivers, springs and
cascades. In addition there are all sorts of natural phenomena: Sulphur
mountains, a mud volcano, petrified forests and over ten thousand active
geysers, hot springs, salfataras and boiling pools. Greatest of all the sights is
the Grand Canon, a ravine varying in depth from one thousand to two thousand
feet. The shelving sides of precipitous crags slope down, presenting an
endless variety of form and color, until they meet at the bed of the Yellowstone
River, which flings itself impetuously along to meet the lake. “A great gulch
let down into the eternities,” such is the opinion of De Witt Talmage on this

to more or less savage people in the past who inhabited dwellings built
on projections from the face of cliffs, or cut out of the solid rock. Sometimes
the houses are four stories high, and divided into many rooms. Often
they are not to be distinguished from the rest of the cliff. Such dwellings are
found in various parts of the world, but nowhere are they so abundant and so
interesting as in Arizona, New Mexico and California. It is generally supposed
that the American cliff-dwellers were the ancestors of the Pueblo Indians.
In some respects the cliff-dweller appears to have been better off than his
modern descendants; the canon walls sheltered him from cyclones and the
overhanging shelves of rock protected him from attack from above. A series
of cliff villages, lining the walls of Walnut Canon, in Northeastern Arizona,
for a length of five miles, was discovered in 1884.</p>

Philadelphia had the finest Masonic Temple in the world. Now that

when the gorgeous new building was begun at the corner of State and Randolph
Streets. The site measures one hundred and seventy feet on State Street
and by one hundred and fourteen on Randolph. Every inch of this space is
covered by the building, whose twenty stories tower up to the height of two
hundred and sixty-five feet. It rests on cement and iron foundations, and its
superstructure is of steel. The first three stories are faced with red granite
from Wisconsin, the remainder with gray brick that is indistinguishable from
the granite. An immense granite arch in the centre of the State Street front
forms the entrance, and opens into an interior court, faced from bottom to top
with different colored marble. The first eleven stories are fitted up for shops,
from the eleventh to the sixteenth inclusive are business offices, while above the

formed in the Niagara River, four miles below Grand Island. Here
the current begins to grow narrow and develops into rapids, which
continue for about a mile, with a descent of fifty-two feet, until the river
plunges over a mighty chasm. Goat Island, at the very verge of the cataract,
divides it into two sheets of water—the Horse-shoe, or Canadian fall, with a
descent of one hundred and fifty-eight feet, and a width of about twenty-six
hundred and forty; and the American fall, one hundred and sixty-two to one
hundred and sixty-nine feet deep, and about one thousand wide. The volume
of water thus precipitated is about fifteen million cubic feet a minute. Nearly
nine-tenths of this passes over the Canadian fall. For some distance below
the Falls there is still water, the mass which has hurled itself into the abyss
sinking and only reappearing two miles below, where the whirlpool rapids
begin.</p>

exaggeration. On the contrary, the group consists of about fifteen hundred
rocky islands, remarkable for their great and varied beauty. They are of all
shapes and sizes, some just peeping above the surface of the waters, others extending
several miles in length, some wild and bare and rocky, others covered

the Victoria Bridge was thrown across the St. Lawrence. Work was
begun in 1854. In 1860 the bridge was formally opened by the Prince of
Wales during his tour through Canada and the United States. This is one of
the greatest triumphs of engineering and architectural skill. The total length

Petersburg, and the Invalides in Paris. The building covers an area of about
three and a half acres. Its total cost has been over $13,000,000. The corner-stone

It is not in itself, however, a pretentious or imposing structure. Yet it

the original Capitol, and painted white like that, its color has given it its name.
The model which the architect had in view was the Palace of the Duke of
Leinster in London, and he has followed his prototype very closely. The
corner-stone was laid in 1792; the building was first occupied by President
John Adams in 1800; it was burned by the British in 1814, and restored and
re-occupied in 1818. Since that time there have been staccato clamors for a

far as possible to their original condition; the east room, where the Declaration
was signed, is ornamented with portraits of the signers and the west room is a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
